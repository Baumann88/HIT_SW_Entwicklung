1. Overview / Whom should this manual help?
--------------------------------------------

This manual is written by the STW development to make other developers 
more familiar with the TC3 GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) 
communication environment. 

Our Motivation for the TC3 - as a teleservice ECU - giving a GPRS Interface is:

	1. User access wireless from whole over the world
	2. TC3 communication wireless to server (wireless)


The next chapter gives an explaination to the Open Source tools which we 
need to established GPRS communication between TC3 and ISP (Internet Service
Provider). A short overview will help to understand how the tools act with
each other. More over a first walking thru of the Linux TC3 environment the
configuration setup, i.e. configuration scripts, will be explained. A step 
by step introduction in setting up a Point-to-Point connection via the GPRS 
modem is coming up in the second last chapter. Finally some of the usefully
scripts will be explained.


2. Linux tools we should use for communication
----------------------------------------------

The following image should give a short overview of the software we need to
established a communication via GPRS.

  2.1 Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon (pppd)
  
  PPP is a mechanism for creating and running IP (Internet Protocol) and 
  other network protocols over a serial link. In our case we try to get 
  a link from a serial modem via GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) in 
  a GSM (Global Service for Mobile communication) network to a ISP (e.g.
  to allow server / internet / other networks access). 
  
  Getting information you need about the PPP server - in our case the 
  ISP. Before you can establish a PPP connection with a server, you 
  need to obtain the following information (from ISP you get your Data
  SIM-Card for the TC3):
  
	- SIM-Card information's
		. PIN e.g. a 4 character code
		. SCA e.g. same like a mobile phone number
		. APN e.g. for t-mobile -> internet.t-d1.de
	- Does the server require the user of PAP/CHAP? If this is the case
	  you need to know the "id" and "secret" you are to use to connecting.
	  There are probably the user name and password of the ISP.
	  
  To handle the tremendous requirements, which are given by establishing 
  a link to a ISP, we use a lot of scripts for configuration (modem, 
  communication parameters, authentication (PAP/CHAP), etc.) and many 
  other for communication. 
  
  Some of the following scripts are described in the next chapters:
	- Configuration scripts
		. /etc/resolv.conf
		. /etc/rc.d/rc.conf
		. /etc/host.conf
		. /etc/ppp/options			# the options pppd uses for all connections
		. /etc/ppp/gprs-options		# the options pppd uses for GPRS connections
		
	- Communication scipts
		. /usr/sbin/pppd			# the PPP binary itself
		. /etc/ppp/gprs-connect		# the dialer / connection script
		. /etc/ppp/gprs-disconnect	# the disconnection script
			
	
  2.2 Chat: Talking to the modem
  
  The chat program defines a conversational exchange between the computer (TC3) 
  and the modem. Its primary purpose is to establish the connection between
  the Point-to-Point Daemon (pppd) and the remote's pppd process (in our case
  the pppd of the ISP).
 

3 Getting the communication configuration step by step

This chapter gives a explanation about the files we need to configure to 
establish a GPRS PPP connection to your ISP. 
	
	Start: The TC3 is turned off!
	1. Put the SIM-Card out of the TC3 SIM-Card Slot
	2. Make sure you have all the information you needed for your SIM-Card 
	   (see chapter 2.1 of this document)
	3. Turn the TC3 on
	
Remember: 
	For the next steps it will estimated you have already configure 
	your TC3 in that way you can communicate with via Ethernet or Serial!
	
Short introduction in this script you have to change by your own,
if you want to connect firs via Ethernet:

	- Script /etc/rc.d/rc.conf
		. Have a look on the following settings:
			1. export ETH0_CONF="DHCP"	# three options STATIC, UBOOT, DHCP 
			   for more information read the script
			2. Settings for eth0 like Domain and DNS these two parameters 
			   will be later generated into /etc/resolv.conf

	3.1 Setup rc.conf for GPRS connection
	
	Open script /etc/rc.d/rc.conf with the editor (e.g ee or vi). Search now to
	"GSM Settings". Set in the SIM-Card parameters you get from your ISP 
	(chapter 2.1), save and exit file.  
	
	3.2 Setting up modem to Address Resolution (DNS)
	
	Translating (resolving) machine (and domain) names into the numbers actually
	used the Internet is the buisiness of machines that offer the Domain Name Service.
	
	When you make a PPP connection, you need to tell your Linux machine where 
	it can get host name to IP number (address resolution) information so that
	you can use the machine names but your computer can translate these to the 
	IP number it needs to do its work.
	
	The best way is to set up Linux so that it knows where to go to get this name
	to number information - automatically. This service is provided by the Domain
	Name Server (DNS) system. All that is neccessary - in our case - is to set 
	"usepeerdns" (for more information read the pppd manual) to the 
	/etc/ppp/gprs-options, if it's not. That means that the TC3 ask the peer for 
	two DNS server addresses. The pppd will create the resolv.conf file containing
	one or two nameserver lines with the addresses supplied by the peer.
		
	3.3 Authentication
	
	In addition your ISP needs an authentification (PAP/CHAP) you have to include
	the following lines to /etc/gprs-connection.
	
		- user "USERNAME"
		- passord "PASSWORD"
		
	For more information about the authentication mechanism under linux consult 
	the manual, your ISP or the Internet :)
	
	
4 Getting a GPRS connection step by step  

This chapter gives a explanation to establish a GPRS PPP connection to your ISP
step by step. 
	
	Start: The TC3 is turned of!
	1. Put the SIM-Card into the TC3 SIM-Card Slot
	2. Switch it on
	
We need now the following applications:
	- /etc/ppp/ppp-start	# connection script which triggers the gprs-connect script
	- /etc/ppp/ppp-stop		# disconnect script which triggers the gprs-disconnect script
	
	4.1 Setting up PPP connection manually
	
	First: Try ppp-start to connect to your ISP. 
	
	Second: Check connection with command: ifconfig
	
	- Connection established when a "ppp0" link encapsulate the Point-to-Point Protocol
		- e.g. iter addr: 80.187.10.158	... IP number of your end of link
		- e.g. P-t-P: 10.0.0.1			... Server IP number
	
	- Connection not established when no "ppp0" link is on top
		- e.g. iter addr: 0.0.0.0
		- e.g. P-t-P: 	  0.0.0.0
		
	Third: You should be able to see a route to the remote host (and beyond). 
		   To do this, issue the command: route
		   The "Kernel IP routing table" will be showen e.g.

		   Destination	Gateway		Genmask			Flags	Metric	Ref	Use	Iface
		   10.0.0.1		*			255.255.255.255	UH		0		0	0	ppp0
		   .
		   .
		   default 		10.0.0.1	0.0.0.0			UG		0		0	0	ppp0
		   
	Note: We have two entries pointing to our ppp interface.
	
		1. Host route, (indicates by the H flag) and that allows us to see the
		   host to which we are connected to - but not further.
		2. This is the default route, established by giving the pppd the option 
		   "defaultroute" - in our case set in gprs-options. This is the route
		   that tells your TC3 (and may your Linuc PC too) to send  any packet 
		   NOT destined for local Ethernet(s) - to which we specified 
		   "networkroutes" - to the PPP Server itself. The PPP Server then is 
		   responsible for routing our packets out onto the Internet and routing
		   the return packets back to us.
		   
		   
	Note: If you do not see the routing table with two entries, someting is wrong!
		   
		   YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE DEFAULT ROUTE!
		   
		   
	Fourth: Test link by "pinging"any URL or IP e.g. URL: www.fh-kempten.de
	
			--> If you get something like that ...
			
			PING www.fh-kempten.de (***.***.***.***) ...
			64 bytes from ***.***.***.***: icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=927ms
			.
			.
			.
			--- www.fh-kempten.de ping statistic ---
			x packets transmitted x received, 0 packets lost, time 
			rt min/avg/max/mdev = 284.007/514.323/927.490/292.795 ms
			
			--> ... it works ;)
			
	Fifth:	Disconnect the PPP connection by executing: ppp-stop
			
	4.2 Debugging
	
	Check if modem works by using a terminal with AT-commandos, e.g.
	
	picocom -b 460800 /dev/ttyPSC3
	
	... terminal is comming up
	
	Type "AT" and return.
	A "OK" should be returned by the modem.
	Communication with the TC3 modem established -> modem works!
	
	
	Debugging during the ppp-start establish the PPP connection, using
	the "tail" program (more information in linux).
	
	tail -f /var/log/messages
