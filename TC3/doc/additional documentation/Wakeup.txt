1. General
----------

   For activating the wakeup mechanism, following scripts must be checked
   and if necessary, changed:
 
   - /etc/rc.d/rc.local
   - /etc/rc.d/rc.conf

   To configure the wakeup mechanism, following setting in the rc.conf
   file are available:
      
   # Wakeup settings
   #export MOTION_WAKEUP="yes"
   #export RTC_WAKEUP="after_sec"
   #export RTC_WAKEUP="tomorrow_at"

   # in combination with "after_sec" RTC_WAKEUP_TIME holds the value in sec
   # in combination with "tomorrow_at" RTC_WAKEUP_TIME hold the value in hhmmss
   export RTC_WAKEUP_TIME=120

   # Run time (minutes) after shutdown (ignation off)
   # set the default value here or wakeup-reason dependend in
   # default vale for ignition wakeup
   export SD_RUN_TIME_IGN=1
   # default value for motion wakeup
   export SD_RUN_TIME_MOT=2
   # default value ofr rtc wakeup
   export SD_RUN_TIME_RTC=3
   # file: wakeups or later in SD_RUN_TIME_FILE
   export SD_RUN_TIME_FILE="/tmp/sdruntime"
   
   In the rc.local file, it's possible to execute own programs and scripts
   for every single run mode (RTC, IGN, MOT, UNKNOWN)
   
   if [ "$1" = "start" ]
   then
      # If woken up by Ignition
      if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "IGN" ]
      then
         echo "IGN-Script..start"
      fi
      # if woken up by RTC
      if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "RTC" ]
      then
         echo "RTC-Script..start"
      fi
      #if woken up by Motion Sensor
      if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "MOT" ]
      then
         echo "MOT-Script..start"
      fi
      # else (UNKNOWN)
      if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "UNKNOWN" ]
      then
         echo "UNKNOWN-Script..start"
      fi
fi

   
2. Wakeup via Motion sensor
---------------------------
   
   First edit the rc.conf file. 
   To activate the motion wakeup mechanism set the "export MOTION_WAKEUP="yes""
   You can also change the "staying alive" time for the Motion wakeup mechanism
   by changing "export SD_RUN_TIME_MOT=2" (2 Minutes stay alive)
   
   Now we want to play "tata" on start up, if the TC3 wakeup mechanism was activated with the
   Motion sensor. For this, edit the rc.local file
   Include following line in the Motion Sensor section:
   /usr/local/bin/tata.beep
   Now the script section should look like the following clipping:
   
   #if woken up by Motion Sensor
   if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "MOT" ]
   then
      echo "MOT-Script..start"
      /usr/local/bin/tata.beep
   fi
   
   Switch off D+. 
   If you hustle the TC3, it will wakeup automatically and play "tata".

3.    Wakeup via RTC
--------------------

   The wakeup mechanism via RTC has to different modes. With the "Wakeup after x seconds"
   mechanism, it's possible to specify the next power up time in seconds.
   With the "Wakeup tomorrow" mechanism, it's possible to specify the time when the TC3
   should wakeup every day.

3.1   Wakeup after x seconds
----------------------------

   To activate the RTC wakeup mechanism set the #export RTC_WAKEUP="after_sec"
   in the rc.conf file. Edit also the export RTC_WAKEUP_TIME to
   export RTC_WAKEUP_TIME=60.
   You can also change the "staying alive" time for the RTC wakeup mechanism
   by changing "export SD_RUN_TIME_RTC=2" (2 Minutes stay alive) 
   Now if you power off D+, the TC3 should wakeup after one 
   minute by rtc and staying alive for 2 minutes.
   
   At least edit the rc.local file. The TC3 should flash the led red if the wakeup reason 
   was the RTC
   
   Add following lines to the sector "RTC" in rc.local:
   echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/status_led/brightness
   
   Now the script section should look like the following clipping:
   
   # if woken up by RTC
   if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "RTC" ]
   then
      echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/status_led/brightness
      echo "RTC-Script..start"
   fi
   

3.2   Wakeup tomorrow 
--------------------

   To activate the RTC wakeup mechanism set the #export RTC_WAKEUP="tomorrow_at"
   in the rc.conf file. Edit also the export RTC_WAKEUP_TIME to
   export RTC_WAKEUP_TIME=130000. This means, that tomorrow at 1 o'clock pm the TC3 wakes up 
   
4.    Wakeup via IGN
--------------------

   That's the normal case. If you turn on the D+ of the TC3, the wakeup mechanism with IGN will
   be activated.
   
   Say we want to change the "stay alive" time to zero.
   In this case, after switching off the D+, the TC3 should shutdown immediately.
   First, change the "stay alive" time to
   # default vale for ignition wakeup
   export SD_RUN_TIME_IGN=0
   
   Add following lines to the sector "IGN" in rc.local:
   echo 2 > /sys/class/leds/status_led/brightness
   
   Now the script section should look like the following clipping:

   # If woken up by Ignition
   if [ "$WAKEUP_REASON" = "IGN" ]
   then
      echo "IGN-Script..start"
      echo 2 > /sys/class/leds/status_led/brightness
   fi
